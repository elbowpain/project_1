Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?‚Äù

*Hello, my name is Anastasiia*
*This project is a great opportunity to start and develop further in this direction. I want to learn as much information as possible and put it into practice. My goal is a remote work, where I am a specialist in this field. Work on big projects. I expect from the project a huge amount of information and practical knowledge.*
